    "## **Fine-tuning BERT for named-entity recognition**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we are going to use **BertForTokenClassification** which is included in the [Transformers library](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) by HuggingFace. This model has BERT as its base architecture, with a token classification head on top, allowing it to make predictions at the token level, rather than the sequence level. Named entity recognition is typically treated as a token classification problem, so that's what we are going to use it for.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial uses the idea of **transfer learning**, i.e. first pretraining a large neural network in an unsupervised way, and then fine-tuning that neural network on a task of interest. In this case, BERT is a neural network pretrained on 2 tasks: masked language modeling and next sentence prediction. Now, we are going to fine-tune this network on a NER dataset. Fine-tuning is supervised learning, so this means we will need a labeled dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to know more about BERT, I suggest the following resources:\n",
    "* the original [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805)\n",
    "* Jay Allamar's [blog post](http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-bert/) as well as his [tutorial](http://jalammar.github.io/a-visual-guide-to-using-bert-for-the-first-time/)\n",
    "* Chris Mccormick's [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoRX98PLOsaN8PtekB9kWrw)\n",
    "* Abbishek Kumar Mishra's [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/abhisheksvnit)\n",
    "\n",
    "The following notebook largely follows the same structure as the tutorials by Abhishek Kumar Mishra. For his tutorials on the Transformers library, see his [Github repository](https://github.com/abhimishra91/transformers-tutorials).\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: this notebook assumes basic knowledge about deep learning, BERT, and native PyTorch. If you want to learn more Python, deep learning and PyTorch, I highly recommend cs231n by Stanford University and the FastAI course by Jeremy Howard et al. Both are freely available on the web.  \n",

    "#### **Downloading and preprocessing the data**\n",
    "Named entity recognition (NER) uses a specific annotation scheme, which is defined (at least for European languages) at the *word* level. An annotation scheme that is widely used is called **[IOB-tagging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside%E2%80%93outside%E2%80%93beginning_(tagging)**, which stands for Inside-Outside-Beginning. Each tag indicates whether the corresponding word is *inside*, *outside* or at the *beginning* of a specific named entity. The reason this is used is because named entities usually comprise more than 1 word.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's have a look at an example. If you have a sentence like \"Barack Obama was born in Hawaï\", then the corresponding tags would be   [B-PERS, I-PERS, O, O, O, B-GEO]. B-PERS means that the word \"Barack\" is the beginning of a person, I-PERS means that the word \"Obama\" is inside a person, \"O\" means that the word \"was\" is outside a named entity, and so on. So one typically has as many tags as there are words in a sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if you want to train a deep learning model for NER, it requires that you have your data in this IOB format (or similar formats such as [BILOU](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17116446/what-do-the-bilou-tags-mean-in-named-entity-recognition)). There exist many annotation tools which let you create these kind of annotations automatically (such as Spacy's [Prodigy](https://prodi.gy/), [Tagtog](https://docs.tagtog.net/) or [Doccano](https://github.com/doccano/doccano)). You can also use Spacy's [biluo_tags_from_offsets](https://spacy.io/api/goldparse#biluo_tags_from_offsets) function to convert annotations at the character level to IOB format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we will use a NER dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/namanj27/ner-dataset) that is already in IOB format. One has to go to this web page, download the dataset, unzip it, and upload the csv file to this notebook. Let's print out the first few rows of this csv file:"

    "A tricky part of NER with BERT is that BERT relies on **wordpiece tokenization**, rather than word tokenization. This means that we should also define the labels at the wordpiece-level, rather than the word-level!\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you have word like \"Washington\" which is labeled as \"b-gpe\", but it gets tokenized to \"Wash\", \"##ing\", \"##ton\", then one approach could be to handle this by only train the model on the tag labels for the first word piece token of a word (i.e. only label \"Wash\" with \"b-gpe\"). This is what was done in the original BERT paper, see Github discussion [here](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/64#issuecomment-443703063).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this is a **design decision**. You could also decide to propagate the original label of the word to all of its word pieces and let the model train on this. In that case, the model should be able to produce the correct labels for each individual wordpiece. This was done in [this NER tutorial with BERT](https://github.com/chambliss/Multilingual_NER/blob/master/python/utils/main_utils.py#L118). Another design decision could be to give the first wordpiece of each word the original word label, and then use the label “X” for all subsequent subwords of that word. All of them seem to lead to good performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we define a regular PyTorch [dataset class](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html) (which transforms examples of a dataframe to PyTorch tensors). Here, each sentence gets tokenized, the special tokens that BERT expects are added, the tokens are padded or truncated based on the max length of the model, the attention mask is created and the labels are created based on the dictionary which we defined above. Word pieces that should be ignored have a label of -100 (which is the default `ignore_index` of PyTorch's [CrossEntropyLoss](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss.html)).\n",

    "Before training the model, let's perform a sanity check, which I learned thanks to Andrej Karpathy's wonderful [cs231n course](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) at Stanford (see also his [blog post about debugging neural networks](http://karpathy.github.io/2019/04/25/recipe/)). The initial loss of your model should be close to -ln(1/number of classes) = -ln(1/17) = 2.83.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why? Because we are using cross entropy loss. The cross entropy loss is defined as -ln(probability score of the model for the correct class). In the beginning, the weights are random, so the probability distribution for all of the classes for a given token will be uniform, meaning that the probability for the correct class will be near 1/17. The loss for a given token will thus be -ln(1/17). As PyTorch's [CrossEntropyLoss](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss.html) (which is used by `BertForTokenClassification`) uses *mean reduction* by default, it will compute the mean loss for each of the tokens in the sequence for which a label is provided.\n",
